# Trip To Colchis

Little project to practice. Firebase Edition.

### Required environnement
* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (>12.16), NPM (>=6.14) and Yarn.
* Install local dev dependencies at the root of the project : `yarn` once in the folder

### Live Development Server

* Environment files have to be added manually / asked so the Firebase link can work.
* Simply run `nx serve client` at root to start the client server with file watcher.
